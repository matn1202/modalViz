### 2026-05-12 — FIX-001: Orbit Controls Regression

**Task:** Bug Fix  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FIX_ORBIT_CONTROLS.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Added `touchAction = 'none'`, implemented strict DOM node clearing on mount, and updated unmount logic to properly dispose all children without stale refs.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes (`npm run build` completed successfully)  
**Tests:** Created automated E2E test script (`src/test/e2e_orbit.js`) using Puppeteer. Script simulates CSV ingestion, renders the 3D scene, and executes programmatic mouse drag events. Visual regression asserts that the `OrbitControls` successfully rotate the camera. Test passed ✅.  
**Notes:** The React 19 StrictMode double-mount issue requires robust `.dispose()` handling in `useEffect`. `touchAction = 'none'` was critical for allowing `OrbitControls` to capture pointer drag events.

### 2026-05-12 — FEAT-P3-001: Animation Controller & Playback Loop

**Task:** Feature  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FEAT-P3-001_ANIMATION_CONTROLLER.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/test/TestHarness2.jsx` — Instantiated `ModalKinematicsEngine` with correct initial conditions and passed it as a prop to `WebGLViewport`.
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Wired the math engine to the `requestAnimationFrame` loop using `useRef` for high-performance animation state. Added playback UI controls (play, pause, stop, scrub slider) and dynamic geometry position updates.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes  
**Tests:** Ran local dev server. Animation playback, pausing, stopping, and timeline scrubbing all function correctly and update the node coordinates frame-by-frame.
**Notes:** Used `useRef` for all rapidly changing animation state (`simTime`, `playbackState`, `lastTimestamp`) to prevent React re-renders from degrading the 60fps loop. Handled both 1-DOF and 3-DOF per node scenarios in the vertex update loop.

### 2026-05-12 — FEAT-P3-002: Jet Colormap & Dynamic Contour Rendering

**Task:** Feature  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FEAT-P3-002_CONTOUR_RENDERING.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/engine/colormap.js` — Created pure Jet colormap utility function.
- `src/engine/ColorBarLegend.jsx` — Created React component for rendering the colormap legend over the 3D viewport.
- `src/test/testColormap.js` — Wrote unit tests for the colormap utility.
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Updated animation and scrub loop to calculate node displacement magnitude, normalized against the min/max values, and dynamically modified the color attributes via the Jet colormap. Added the legend UI.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes  
**Tests:** Executed unit tests (`node src/test/testColormap.js`) with 12 passing assertions. Built the app using `npm run build` which succeeded cleanly.
**Notes:** Employed magnitude calculation branching for both 1-DOF and 3-DOF per node datasets. Throttled state updates on the ColorBarLegend to every 10 frames to preserve 60FPS animation performance.

### 2026-05-12 — FEAT-P3-004: Simulation Parameters Panel

**Task:** Feature  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FEAT-P3-004_SIMULATION_PARAMETERS.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/engine/ModalKinematicsEngine.js` — Added `setActiveModes` for mode isolation/superposition and `setDampingRatio` for dynamic decay updates. Both methods were safely wired into the analytical formulas.
- `src/test/testEngineExtensions.js` — Created unit tests verifying engine behavior changes.
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Built and integrated the Simulation Parameters Panel UI. Added state, refs, and wired handlers for: mode selection, exaggeration scale, damping ratio, and per-DOF initial physical conditions (displacement and velocity). 

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes  
**Tests:** Ran `node src/test/testEngineExtensions.js` containing 7 assertions validating active modes filters and dynamic omegaD recalculation; all passed. Built app with zero errors.
**Notes:** Maintained real-time 60 FPS performance by keeping exaggeration scale decoupled from React render loops via `useRef`. State changes like applying new Initial Conditions cleanly reset the simulation timeline to zero and pause the animation.

### 2026-05-12 — FEAT-P4-001: Raycasting & Node Selection

**Task:** Feature  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FEAT-P4-001_RAYCASTING.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Added `THREE.Raycaster` setup and `pointerdown`/`pointerup` handlers to distinguish node clicks from orbit drags (3px threshold). Added a green sphere highlight mesh that updates its position during the `requestAnimationFrame` loop. Hooked selected node details into state to display an info badge with `nodeId` and `dofIndex`.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes (`npm run build` completed successfully)  
**Tests:** Built app successfully.
**Notes:** Computed `dofIndex` dynamically based on `engine.totalDofs / engine.numNodes` to future-proof 1-DOF vs 3-DOF per node geometries. Kept performance high by tracking highlight mesh coordinates directly alongside vertex updates in the animate loop rather than via React state.

### 2026-05-12 — FEAT-P4-002: Plotly.js Integration & 2D Kinematic Plots

**Task:** Feature  
**Work Order From:** Director  
**Spec From:** `docs/feats/FEAT-P4-002_PLOTLY_INTEGRATION.md`  
**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` — Installed `plotly.js-dist-min`.
- `src/engine/RollingBuffer.js` — [NEW] Created fixed-capacity circular buffer utility using `Float64Array`.
- `src/engine/KinematicPlots.jsx` — [NEW] Created React component rendering three synchronized Plotly charts.
- `src/engine/WebGLViewport.jsx` — Instantiated rolling buffers, extracted scoped kinematics during animation, throttled chart updates to ~10 Hz (every 6 frames), and injected `KinematicPlots` to display live `u(t)`, `v(t)`, and `a(t)`.
- `src/test/testRollingBuffer.js` — [NEW] Added unit tests for circular buffer logic.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes  
**Tests:** `testRollingBuffer.js` passed all 15 assertions. Built app successfully.
**Notes:** Used `plotly.js-dist-min` to avoid massive bundle bloat. Throttled DOM updates via `Plotly.react` explicitly instead of generic state mapping to ensure the 60fps WebGL loop remains unaffected by 2D graph re-renders. Circular buffer correctly overrides old time-series data ensuring constant O(1) memory footprint.
